## Fixed

### ~~Session title truncation / hover actions~~ -- Fixed (Sprint 16)

- **Was:** Action icons reserved ~30px of space even when invisible, truncating titles.
- **Fix:** Wrapped all action buttons in a `.session-actions` overlay container with `position:absolute`. Titles now use full available width. Actions appear on hover with a gradient fade from the right edge.

### ~~Folder/project assignment interaction feels sticky~~ -- Fixed (Sprint 16)

- **Was:** Folder icon stayed permanently visible (blue, 60% opacity) when a session belonged to a project.
- **Fix:** Replaced `.has-project` persistent button with a colored left border matching the project color. The folder button now only appears in the hover overlay like all other actions.

### ~~Project picker clipping and width~~ -- Fixed (v0.17.3)

- **Was:** Picker was clipped by `overflow:hidden` on `.session-item` ancestors. With `position:fixed`, no containing block constrained width -- picker stretched to full viewport.
- **Fix:** Dynamic width calculation (min 160px, max 220px). Event listener reordering. Cleanup sequence corrected. (PR #25)

### ~~NameError crash in model discovery~~ -- Fixed (v0.17.3)

- **Was:** `logger.debug()` called in custom endpoint `except` block, but `logger` was never imported in `config.py`. Every failed endpoint fetch crashed with `NameError`.
- **Fix:** Replaced with silent `pass` -- unreachable endpoints are expected when no local LLM is configured. (PR #24)

## Notes

- Sprint 16 replaced all emoji HTML entities with monochrome SVG line icons (`ICONS` constant in `sessions.js`).
- All session action buttons now use the overlay pattern for consistent UX.
