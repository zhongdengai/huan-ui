# Hermes Web UI

[Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/) is a sophisticated autonomous agent that lives on your server, accessed via a terminal or messaging apps, that remembers what it learns and gets more capable the longer it runs.

Hermes WebUI is a lightweight, dark-themed web app interface in your browser for [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/).
Full parity with the CLI experience - everything you can do from a terminal,
you can do from this UI. No build step, no framework, no bundler. Just Python
and vanilla JS.

Layout: three-panel Claude-style. Left sidebar for sessions and tools,
center for chat, right for workspace file browsing.

This gives you nearly **1:1 parity with Hermes CLI from a convenient web UI** which you can access securely through an SSH tunnel from your Hermes setup. Single command to start this up, and a single command to SSH tunnel for access on your computer. Every single part of the web UI uses your existing Hermes agent and existing models, without requiring any additional setup.

## Why Hermes

Most AI tools reset every session. They don't know who you are, what you worked on, or what
conventions your project follows. You re-explain yourself every time.

Hermes retains context across sessions, runs scheduled jobs while you're offline, and gets
smarter about your environment the longer it runs. It uses your existing Hermes agent setup,
your existing models, and requires no additional configuration to start.

What makes it different from other agentic tools:

- **Persistent memory** — user profile, agent notes, and a skills system that saves reusable
  procedures; Hermes learns your environment and does not have to relearn it
- **Self-hosted scheduling** — cron jobs that fire while you're offline and deliver results to
  Telegram, Discord, Slack, Signal, email, and more
- **10+ messaging platforms** — the same agent available in the terminal is reachable from your phone
- **Self-improving skills** — Hermes writes and saves its own skills automatically from experience;
  no marketplace to browse, no plugins to install
- **Provider-agnostic** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, OpenRouter, and more
- **Orchestrates other agents** — can spawn Claude Code or Codex for heavy coding tasks and bring
  the results back into its own memory
- **Self-hosted** — your conversations, your memory, your hardware

**vs. the field** *(landscape is actively shifting — see [HERMES.md](HERMES.md) for the full breakdown)*:

| | OpenClaw | Claude Code | Codex CLI | OpenCode | Hermes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Persistent memory (auto) | Yes | Partial† | Partial | Partial | Yes |
| Scheduled jobs (self-hosted) | Yes | No‡ | No | No | Yes |
| Messaging app access | Yes (15+ platforms) | Partial (Telegram/Discord preview) | No | No | Yes (10+) |
| Web UI (self-hosted) | Dashboard only | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| Self-improving skills | Partial | No | No | No | Yes |
| Python / ML ecosystem | No (Node.js) | No | No | No | Yes |
| Provider-agnostic | Yes | No (Claude only) | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Open source | Yes (MIT) | No | Yes | Yes | Yes |

† Claude Code has CLAUDE.md / MEMORY.md project context and rolling auto-memory, but not full automatic cross-session recall  
‡ Claude Code has cloud-managed scheduling (Anthropic infrastructure) and session-scoped `/loop`; no self-hosted cron

**The closest competitor is OpenClaw** — both are always-on, self-hosted, open-source agents
with memory, cron, and messaging. The key differences: Hermes writes and saves its own skills
automatically as a core behavior (OpenClaw's skill system centers on a community marketplace);
Hermes is more stable across updates (OpenClaw has documented release regressions and ClawHub
has had security incidents involving malicious skills); and Hermes runs natively in the Python
ecosystem. See [HERMES.md](HERMES.md) for the full side-by-side.

## Quick start

First, you need to install and configure [Hermes Agent](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart) on your computer or server. This includes the following steps to complete:

* [ ] Running the `curl` command to download and setup Hermes
* [ ] Configure your [LLM provider](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/getting-started/quickstart#2-set-up-a-provider) with `hermes model`
* [ ] Configure yout [messaging gateways](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/messaging/) with `hermes gateway setup`
* [ ] Can start chatting with hermes on command-line with `hermes`
* [ ] Optional: [Configure your extended memory provider](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/memory-providers)
* [ ] Optional: [Configure your tools](https://hermes-agent.nousresearch.com/docs/user-guide/features/tools)

Once installed, you can now setup the web UI with:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nesquena/hermes-webui.git hermes-webui
cd hermes-webui
./start.sh
```

That is it! The script will:

1. Locate your Hermes agent directory automatically.
2. Find (or create) a Python environment with the required dependencies.
3. Start the web server.
4. Print the URL (and SSH tunnel command if you are on a remote machine).

---

## Docker

**Pre-built images** (amd64 + arm64) are published to GHCR on every release:

```bash
docker pull ghcr.io/nesquena/hermes-webui:latest
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -v ~/.hermes:/root/.hermes ghcr.io/nesquena/hermes-webui:latest
```

Or run with Docker Compose (recommended):

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

Or build locally:

```bash
docker build -t hermes-webui .
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -v ~/.hermes:/root/.hermes hermes-webui
```

Open http://localhost:8787 in your browser.

To enable password protection:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8787:8787 -e HERMES_WEBUI_PASSWORD=your-secret -v ~/.hermes:/root/.hermes ghcr.io/nesquena/hermes-webui:latest
```

Session data persists in a named volume (`hermes-data`) across restarts.

> **Note:** By default, Docker Compose binds to `127.0.0.1` (localhost only).
> To expose on a network, change the port to `"8787:8787"` in `docker-compose.yml`
> and set `HERMES_WEBUI_PASSWORD` to enable authentication.

---

## What start.sh discovers automatically

| Thing | How it finds it |
|---|---|
| Hermes agent dir | `HERMES_WEBUI_AGENT_DIR` env, then `~/.hermes/hermes-agent`, then sibling `../hermes-agent` |
| Python executable | Agent venv first, then `.venv` in this repo, then system `python3` |
| State directory | `HERMES_WEBUI_STATE_DIR` env, then `~/.hermes/webui-mvp` |
| Default workspace | `HERMES_WEBUI_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE` env, then `~/workspace`, then state dir |
| Port | `HERMES_WEBUI_PORT` env or first argument, default `8787` |

If discovery finds everything, nothing else is required.

---

## Overrides (only needed if auto-detection misses)

```bash
export HERMES_WEBUI_AGENT_DIR=/path/to/hermes-agent
export HERMES_WEBUI_PYTHON=/path/to/python
export HERMES_WEBUI_PORT=9000
./start.sh
```

Or inline:

```bash
HERMES_WEBUI_AGENT_DIR=/custom/path ./start.sh 9000
```

Full list of environment variables:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `HERMES_WEBUI_AGENT_DIR` | auto-discovered | Path to the hermes-agent checkout |
| `HERMES_WEBUI_PYTHON` | auto-discovered | Python executable |
| `HERMES_WEBUI_HOST` | `127.0.0.1` | Bind address |
| `HERMES_WEBUI_PORT` | `8787` | Port |
| `HERMES_WEBUI_STATE_DIR` | `~/.hermes/webui-mvp` | Where sessions and state are stored |
| `HERMES_WEBUI_DEFAULT_WORKSPACE` | `~/workspace` | Default workspace |
| `HERMES_WEBUI_DEFAULT_MODEL` | `openai/gpt-5.4-mini` | Default model |
| `HERMES_WEBUI_PASSWORD` | *(unset)* | Set to enable password authentication |
| `HERMES_HOME` | `~/.hermes` | Base directory for Hermes state (affects all paths) |
| `HERMES_CONFIG_PATH` | `~/.hermes/config.yaml` | Path to Hermes config file |

---

## Accessing from a remote machine

The server binds to `127.0.0.1` by default (loopback only). If you are running
Hermes on a VPS or remote server, use an SSH tunnel from your local machine:

```bash
ssh -N -L <local-port>:127.0.0.1:<remote-port> <user>@<server-host>
```

Example:

```bash
ssh -N -L 8787:127.0.0.1:8787 user@your.server.com
```

Then open `http://localhost:8787` in your local browser.

`start.sh` will print this command for you automatically when it detects you
are running over SSH.

---

## Accessing on your phone with Tailscale

[Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) is a zero-config mesh VPN built on
WireGuard. Install it on your server and your phone, and they join the same
private network -- no port forwarding, no SSH tunnels, no public exposure.

The Hermes Web UI is fully responsive with a mobile-optimized layout
(hamburger sidebar, bottom navigation bar, touch-friendly controls), so it
works well as a daily-driver agent interface from your phone.

**Setup:**

1. Install [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com/download) on your server and
   your iPhone/Android.
2. Start the WebUI listening on all interfaces with password auth enabled:

```bash
HERMES_WEBUI_HOST=0.0.0.0 HERMES_WEBUI_PASSWORD=your-secret ./start.sh
```

3. Open `http://<server-tailscale-ip>:8787` in your phone's browser
   (find your server's Tailscale IP in the Tailscale app or with
   `tailscale ip -4` on the server).

That's it. Traffic is encrypted end-to-end by WireGuard, and password auth
protects the UI at the application level. You can add it to your home screen
for an app-like experience.

> **Tip:** If using Docker, set `HERMES_WEBUI_HOST=0.0.0.0` in your
> `docker-compose.yml` environment (already the default) and set
> `HERMES_WEBUI_PASSWORD`.

---

## Manual launch (without start.sh)

If you prefer to launch the server directly:

```bash
cd /path/to/hermes-agent          # or wherever sys.path can find Hermes modules
HERMES_WEBUI_PORT=8787 venv/bin/python /path/to/hermes-webui/server.py
```

Note: use the agent venv Python (or any Python environment that has the Hermes agent dependencies installed). System Python will be missing `openai`, `httpx`, and other required packages.

Health check:

```bash
curl http://127.0.0.1:8787/health
```

---

## Running tests

Tests discover the repo and the Hermes agent dynamically -- no hardcoded paths.

```bash
cd hermes-webui
pytest tests/ -v --timeout=60
```

Or using the agent venv explicitly:

```bash
/path/to/hermes-agent/venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests run against an isolated server on port 8788 with a separate state directory.
Production data and real cron jobs are never touched. Current count: **433 tests**
across 23 test files.
